- building docker image should have spinner

- Env vars should use `--prod` to delete prod, instead of deleting prod by default and using `--preview` to delete preview
- Fix spacing issues (use debug flag `CDP_DEBUG=1 cdp`) to see where it is coming from
- **BIG THING:** allow preview deployments with git setup  
  - For Docker this cannot work, but git deploys should set up Coolify to work with GitHub PRs on the deploy repo
- Get `ls` command to work (`cdp ls`) and list deployments
- Test `link` command / get working if broken
- Unify UI (if needed)
- Add a verbose flag to disable spinners on deploy and show git/docker/etc output when doing stuff  
  - This should be different from debug, since debug only shows command output
- Logs should show what was picked instead of generic output like:
```

step 1
step 2
step 3
deploying to coolify...
done!

```
The output should be:
```

step 1
> git
step 2
> private repo
etc
deploying to coolify...

```

long term:
- add cloudflare api functionality, basically this should auto add a dns record to cf with the custom domain I chose, and then point it toward my server, depending on if i want it proxied or unproxied
