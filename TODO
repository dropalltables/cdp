- move detection to https://github.com/coollabsio/coolpack

- **BIG THING:** allow preview deployments with git setup  
  - For Docker this cannot work, but git deploys should set up Coolify to work with GitHub PRs on the deploy repo
- Get `ls` command to work (`cdp ls`) and list deployments
- Test `link` command / get working if broken

long term:
- add cloudflare api functionality, basically this should auto add a dns record to cf with the custom domain I chose, and then point it toward my server, depending on if i want it proxied or unproxied
